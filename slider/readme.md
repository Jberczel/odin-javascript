##Project: Project: Creating an Image Carousel/Slider in Javascript

###Objective: 
Create a simple image carousel site. It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backwards. It should automatically move forward every 5 seconds. It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on (and they should be click-able to advance to that particular slide).
