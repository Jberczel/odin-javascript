##Project: Putting Google Maps Onto Your Site with Javascript

###Objective: 
Create a simple site that has just a Google map on it and a form where the user can enter a latitude and longitude and a message. When the form is submitted, a marker is placed on the map in that location. Clicking the marker should bring up the message that was entered (you don't need to create this functionality yourself -- if you set up the marker properly then Maps will do it for you).
