##Project: jQuery and the DOM (Build Classic Snake Game)

###Objective: 
Let's give you a chance to dive deeply into working with events by building a Snake game.

**Note**: I wanted to get a better grasp of OOP in JS, so I delayed working on this project and began reading the the "Deeper into Javascipt" section of the curriculum. 

While exploring the more intermediate JS topics, I found this terrific youtube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU5YPIvJ24Y), and decided to follow along and build this game. It's a good refresher on OOP design, especially as it relates to JS.
